# Machine Failures Detection with Autoencoder LSTM

This project is related to the process of detecting machine failures of NASA bearing dataset (https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/3/). In this case, we will use an algorithm called Autoencoder LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). 

## A Brief Introduction to Autoencoder LSTM

Autoencoder is a sequence process of encoding and decoding data. This process is typically used when dealing with unsupervised learning when there is no label in the data. The encoder part will make the data features to be compacted. This step looks for the best representiation of multivariate data. For example, we have (*n_samples*, *y time_steps*, *n_features*) input data. By using the autoencoder, we can find the best representiation of data in the shapee (*n_samples*, *n_features*). The number of *n_features* in the output normally should be less than the input because of the nature of encoding itself (finding the best representation of data). Decoding is the opposite of encoding. This part tries to decompose the compacted-features of the data.

LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) is a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) process. This algoritm is different with the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) or other network architecture. LSTM includes previous step (look back) to calculate/predict the next data. LSTM is usually be a part of time-series analysis tools.

## Dataset Description 
The dataset is a pre-processed data taken from NASA repository (https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/3/) Set No. 2. The original data has been processed by taking the mean absolute for each file. Based on the dataset documentation, the dataset measures the vibration signals in each 4 bearings of a machine with sampling rate 20 kHz. The data starts from 12<sup>th</sup> February 2004 to 19<sup>th</sup> February 2004. 

| Column Name | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| Index | Timestamp index. The timestamp difference between each data is 10 minutes| 
| Bearing 1 | The vibration signal from bearing 1 |
| Bearing 2 | The vibration signal from bearing 2 |
| Bearing 3 | The vibration signal from bearing 3 |
| Bearing 4 | The vibration signal from bearing 4 |
